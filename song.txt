My favorite game lyrics

I don't know what you're looking for
You haven't found it baby, that's for sure
You rip me up, you spread me all around
In the dust of the deed of time

And this is no case of lust you see
Its not a matter of you versus me
Its fine the way you want me on your own
But in the end its always me alone

I'm losing my favourite game
You're losing your mind again
I'm losing my baby, losing my favourite game

I only know what I've been working for
Another you so I could love you more
I really thought that I could take you there
But my experiment is not getting us anywhere
